```

**Removed deprecated files:**

- All Jekyll files (`Gemfile`, `_config.yml`, etc.)
- Legacy backup directories (`legacy/`, `site-backup/`)
- Conflicting HTML files (`index.html`)
- Old backup files (`README-backup.md`)

## Next Steps

### 1. **Set Up Auto-Sync** (5 minutes)

Follow the guide in `docs-management/SETUP-SUMMARY.md`:

- Add workflow to main Annie repository
- Create and configure GitHub personal access token
- Test the sync process

### 2. **Deploy to Netlify** (5 minutes)

The site is already live at [annie-docs.netlify.app](https://annie-docs.netlify.app/)!

For manual deployment or custom domains, follow the guide in `docs-management/ANNIE-IO-DEPLOYMENT.md`

### 3. **Verify Everything Works**

- Auto-sync triggers when main repo changes
- Documentation builds successfully  
- Site is live at https://annie-docs.netlify.app/
- SSL certificate is active
