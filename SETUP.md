# Documentation Site - Fixed Configuration

## Summary of Changes

The documentation site has been restructured to work properly with **MkDocs** instead of the mixed Jekyll/MkDocs configuration that was causing conflicts.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **MkDocs Configuration**
- Created proper `mkdocs.yml` configuration file
- Set up navigation structure for all documentation pages
- Configured ReadTheDocs theme
- Set proper source (`docs/`) and build (`site/`) directories

### 2. **Documentation Content**
- Cleaned up `docs/index.md` to match the intended homepage
- Maintained all existing API documentation in `docs/api/`
- Kept examples and feature documentation intact
- Added proper navigation links

### 3. **Jekyll Configuration**
- Updated `_config.yml` to exclude MkDocs files from Jekyll processing
- Modified `index.markdown` to redirect to MkDocs site
- Updated `about.markdown` with project information

### 4. **Build System**
- Created `build-docs.sh` script for easy building
- Created `deploy.sh` script for deployment
- Added Python virtual environment support
- Updated `requirements.txt` with MkDocs dependencies

### 5. **File Organization**
- Added proper `.gitignore` rules
- Removed conflicting `index.html` file
- Created `README.md` with clear instructions

## Current Structure

```
Annie-Docs/
├── docs/                    # MkDocs source files
│   ├── index.md            # Main documentation page
│   ├── api/                # API reference
│   ├── examples.md         # Usage examples
│   ├── concurrency.md      # Concurrency features
│   └── filtering.md        # Filtered search
├── site/                   # Generated MkDocs site (DO NOT EDIT)
├── mkdocs.yml              # MkDocs configuration
├── build-docs.sh           # Build script
├── deploy.sh               # Deployment script
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## How to Use

### Building the Documentation
```bash
# Easy way
./build-docs.sh

# Manual way
source venv/bin/activate
mkdocs build
```

### Serving Locally
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
mkdocs serve
```

### Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent Build System**: Pure MkDocs workflow
2. **No More Conflicts**: Removed Jekyll/MkDocs conflicts
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Simple scripts for building and deployment
4. **Professional Look**: ReadTheDocs theme with proper navigation
5. **Fast Builds**: MkDocs builds much faster than Jekyll

The documentation site now works properly and can be built consistently across different environments.
